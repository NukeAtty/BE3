# Bellum Æternum III Core Design

## Theatres
Bellum Æternum III will have only one type of theatre, modified from New Urban.
In the future, there might be two.

## Terrains
Completely new, no bridges, no waters, no shores.

## Urban Combat
Infantries can occupy buildings, but building would be penetrate by certain ammunitions:
- Cannon Shell
- Missile
- Beam
- Flame
All buildings will have wreckage upon destroyed, but they will be buildings instead of terrain object.

## Ore
ORE stands for Overpowered Rare Element, is the mystic ore only found on Planet.
GEM stands for Glorious Extraterrestial Material, is another mystic ore found on Plant, different from ORE, GEM is very precious but unstable.
